# WPLANPY. A Python Tool for Scheduling Vessels in Inland Waterways

## Python Tool for scheduling vessels in natural inland waterways subject to different operationl constraints

The aim of this project is the development of a library of functions for the optimal and safe planning of the navigation of inland natural waterways.
The objective is to schedule vessels' trip plans so that waiting and transit times are minized while meeting a series of operationl constraints. Every part of this project is a sample code which show you how to do the following:

* Define the operational constraints associated to solving the problem of scheduling vessels in natural inland waterwasy.
* Calculate a series of  crossing windows for safe navigation taking into account the effect of the tide.
* Solve an optimization problem for finding the optimal trip plan of each vessel. This optimal trip plan is a collection of times when each vessel shoudl cross through each waypoint in the waterway.
